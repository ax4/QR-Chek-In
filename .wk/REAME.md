# QR-CHECK-IN is now a weekly hacking proposal!

Recently, I am trying to design a framework of teamworking, I call it "Weekly Hacking".

It has two important dates every week: 
1. Idea Friday.   Just establish your idea of what you're going to work on, in the next week. 
2. Present Sunday. Present anything you want! And never forget to inform others, how good/bad you've done last week. 

Advice about your weekly idea: 

1. Define your question + main task. 
2. Split some sub-tasks, to let others help you / understand you with hand-on experience. 
3. attract other people, when you make your idea established.   

The Life Cycle of an weekly idea

1. Friday of THIS week. Establish an idea. 
2. Your weekend, trying to attract others, about your idea, and let them know, what sub-tasks, they could do to help you. 
3. Sunday of NEXT week. Present anything!

I wish this framework, could help each hacker, develop their own stuff, and as well stay connected with others. ðŸ˜Š
